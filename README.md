# The-Clock
Displays transport info REALLY BIG

Just a big display of your DAW's Transport and Timeline info as a VST3/AU.

Works on any channel. Audio passes through it, or put it on a dummy track.

Displays BPM, time signature, total number of beats, and if loop is active on the left.
On the right it desplays Bars and Beats, and Minutes and Seconds, REALLY BIG.
